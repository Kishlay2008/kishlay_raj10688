"Loop optimization Demo : Convert second to hours , minutes, and seconds using for and while loops, with iteration coparison."
# Loop Optimization Demo

## Project Aim
This project demonstrates *loop optimization* by converting a given number of seconds into *hours, minutes, and seconds* using both *for* and *while loops. The project also compares the **number of iterations* for both loops.

## Problem Statement
- Convert a user-input number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Solve the problem using *for loop* and *while loop*.
- Compare the iteration counts and results.

## Logic
- 1 hour = 3600 seconds
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- Use loops to subtract hours and minutes iteratively from the total seconds.

## Comparison Table

| Feature        | For Loop | While Loop |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| Output         | Same     | Same       |
| Iteration Count| Depends on input | Depends on input |
| Readability    | Compact  | Easy to understand |

## Conclusion
- Both loops give the *same result* and *iteration count* depends on input.
- Loop optimization mainly depends on *logic, not on choosing between **for* or *while* loop.
